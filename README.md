AssGPT is a simple UI for ChatGPT, which you can install as a PWA.

An API key is required [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys].



* All data (conversations, API keys) are stored in the user's browser (localStorage) in an unencrypted form.

* Communication happens directly with OpenAI servers.

* The conversation retains context (the entire conversation is transmitted).



Use at your own risk.
